# The Idea

In this section of the report, I will be outlining my proposed idea. This
section is split into 4 sub sections:

* 'A Reddit Alternative' - Here I explain what Reddit is, this will give a good
  idea of what kind of platform Corum will attempt to be.
* 'A Self Governing Democracy' - Here I explain what the main feature of Corum
  is and why it is a good idea.
* 'An Open Platform' - Here I explain how the self governance of the platform
  continues into the development of the platform.
* 'A Modern Interface' - Here I talk about how the user interface of Corum will
  be modern compared to a rather dated looking Reddit.
