# Testing

This section shows how I performed my final testing for Corum. Each sub section
has a title which explains what feature it being tested, a GIF that shows the
feature in action, as well as a bullet point list of what functionality is shown
in the GIF as well as any assumptions that had been made that are not visually
apparent. At this stage of development I decided to perform white box testing as
the project was finished, and this type of testing best represents what the end
user will experience.
