# A Reddit Alternative

If you do not already know what [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) is, this
section will explain the basic premise behind it. Reddit was founded in 2005,
and has largely remained the same since its inception.

As Wikipedia puts it (paraphrased):

> Reddit is a **social news aggregation**, **web content rating** and
> **discussion** website.
>
> Reddit's registered community members can submit content such as text posts or
> links. Registered users can then vote submissions up or down that determines
> their position on the page. Submissions with the most up-votes appear on the
> front page or the top of a category. Content entries are organized by areas of
> interest called "subreddits".
