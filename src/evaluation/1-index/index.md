# Evaluation

Placeholder

## Structure Idea

* Move testing section from dev into here
  * Flesh out dev section of iteration + tests a lot more
* Success of the Solution (With reference to test data)
  * Cross reference test evidence with success criteria and evaluate how well
    the criteria has been met. If any have not been fully met, comment on how
    they could be met with further development.
  * One major one I can think of now (Not currently in the success criteria) is
    that the ergonomics of deployment is not the best. One solution to this
    would be to move the API to Prisma and offer an option to host the API and
    the client on the same machine with a single command.
* Define usability features justify their success
  * Quick loading between actions
  * Instant search of subforums
  * Optimistic UI updates (For example, adding a comment or voting on a post)
  * Loading states
    * On loading navigation lists
    * On loading a subforum or a post
    * Signup and login loading states
  * Helpful error messages
* Identify limitations of the solution and possible maintenance issues
* Talk about how these limitations could be fixed
