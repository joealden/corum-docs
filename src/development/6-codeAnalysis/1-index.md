# Code Analysis

The following sections analyse the final code for both the client and the API of
Corum. It is worth noting that I am using modern JavaScript, (Up to ES2017) so
if you do not recognise some any of the syntax used, I recommend visiting the
following link, [https://devhints.io/es6](https://devhints.io/es6)

To find the full source code, visit the following Github links:

* [https://github.com/joealden/corum-client](https://github.com/joealden/corum-client)
* [https://github.com/joealden/corum-api](https://github.com/joealden/corum-api)

The reason why I have not included the full source code in this report is
because it is very large and split across nearly a hundred files. If you look at
the source code on Github you can be sure that I have not modified it after I
submitted this report. This is because every change that I make to the codebase
is recorded along with the date and time. If you visit the links above you can
see that I have not modified either the client or the API codebase since 15th
March 2018.
