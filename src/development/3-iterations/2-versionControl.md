# Version Control

* Used git for version control and uploaded to github

## Why Version Control?

* Code is always safe (Present on github and on both my machines)
* Means that I can go back it time if something goes wrong and I just want it in
  working state
* Means that the development process was self documenting, as each change has an
  accompanying commit message
