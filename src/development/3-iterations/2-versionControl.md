# Version Control

Corum uses version control to manage and store the project. Specifically, Corum
uses Git and has the repository uploaded to Github. The way that version control
(git in particular) works is that when a change is made to the codebase, the
developer makes something called a 'commit'. This contains a diff of the
codebase with the state before and the state after the changes. This diff is
sent along with a message describing the change.

## Why Version Control?

Version control offers a lot of benefits, the main one is that when a change is
made to the codebase, the state of the project at the moment in time is
recorded. This means

* Code is always safe (Present on github and on both my machines)
* Means that I can go back it time if something goes wrong and I just want it in
  working state
* Means that the development process was self documenting, as each change has an
  accompanying commit message
