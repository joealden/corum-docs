This component will handle nearly all of the client side routing (see
[Route Design](#route-design)), whatever action a user takes, such as clicking
on a sub-forum, pressing the `Sign Up` or `Login` buttons, clicking on a post
within a sub-forum etc. (shown in the [GUI Design section](#gui-design))
