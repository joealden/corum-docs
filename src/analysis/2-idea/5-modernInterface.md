# A Modern Interface

As mentioned previously, Reddit has not changed how it looks or feels very much
at all since it was created in 2005. However, the reasoning behind this decision
is probably that they do not want to make it feel unfamiliar for returning
users. For Corum, this means that I can completely rethink the way a forum
should look, feel and function, as it is a new project. With that being said, it
is important that the transition from Reddit to Corum is as easy as possible for
new users. So, if I keep the basic features of Reddit intact and keep the UI &
UX simple, new users should be able to get up and running with Corum quickly.
