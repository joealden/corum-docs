# An Open Platform

While it is one thing to keep the platform itself democratic, it is also
important that the management and development is kept democratic as well. As of
1st September 2017, after many years of being open source,
[Reddit has decided to stop developing in the open](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6xh3xp/reddits_main_code_is_no_longer_opensource).
As an advocate for open source, I believe that Reddit has made the wrong
decision here.

Being open source means that anyone who wants to contribute can. They can easily
propose new features, report and/or fix bugs, and freely read the source code
knowing that anyone else can too. Developers cannot go hiding things in the
source code like unnecessary tracking etc. Every decision made by the project is
made by the users.

This means that ultimately, the users of the forum decide the direction that
Corum takes in _all_ aspects.
