# Structure of the Project

In this section I will be talking about how the structure of Corum started off,
how it changed over time, and how it ended up.

This section is split into three sub sections:

* 'Monolith vs Micro' - This is where I talk about how the structure of Corum
  changed over time.
* 'Client' - This is where I give an overview of how the client side of the
  project is structured in its final form.
* 'API' - This is where I give an overview of how the API of the project is
  structured in its final form.
