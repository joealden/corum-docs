# Problems experienced

In this section I will be talking about what problems I experienced during the
iterative implementation phase of development as well as what I did to fix them.

This section is split into two sub sections:

* 'Client Problems' - This is where I talk about the issues I had with the
  frontend of Corum.
* 'API Problems' - This is where I talk about the issues I had with the API of
  Corum.
