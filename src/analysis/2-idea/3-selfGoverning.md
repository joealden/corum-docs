# A Self Governing Democracy

Being self governed means that those that are being governed, govern themselves
and each other. There is no higher authority that makes decisions. In the case
of a forum site, this means that it is solely up to the users of the forum as a
collective to decide what content belongs on it. Corum will be designed and
developed from the ground up to strictly follow this principle.

Users will be given one vote each on every post, and each vote will be treated
equally. Up until now, this sounds very similar to
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). The way that Corum differentiates itself from
existing solutions like Reddit is by making the vote that users are given
actually mean something. If users generally vote positively on a post, then the
post will remain. However, if a post gets a mostly negative response, it will be
automatically removed from the sub forum that it was posted in. This means that
if someone posts something that doesn't belong on the forum, it will be removed
by the users themselves _fairly_. This is instead of having a moderator remove
it based on their own opinion of the post, which could be biased.

The idea of having self governing forum software means that the role of the
forum moderator no longer needs to exist.

This is a good thing because:

* It means that the forum requires less maintenance. (Less man power required)
* The users of the forum are responsible for maintaining it. (More **neutral**
  and **fair**)
* The removal of the moderator role keeps code complexity down. (Only one type
  of user account needs to exist, and no 'admin control panel' is required)
