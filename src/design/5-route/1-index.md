# Route Design

As Corum is a website, accessing different parts of the application is done by
routing (For example, clicking on links or altering the contents of the URL bar)
As mentioned before, I am using Vue as my view layer library. This means that I
can easily do client side routing using the accompanying library vue-router.
Client side routing is where the routing is done on the users machine. (More
information on this web development technique can be found by searching for
SPAs.
([Single Page Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application))
This is the opposite to server side routing that is common for sites developed
with PHP and no view library. Server side routing means loading entire new pages
from a server, instead of dynamically rewriting the current page.

As quoted from Wikipedia's article on SPAs:

> This approach avoids interruption of the user experience between successive
> pages, making the application behave more like a desktop application.
