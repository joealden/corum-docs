# The Investigation

In this section of the report, I will explain how I performed an investigation
that will be used to inform me on what features Corum should have. This section
is split into 4 sub sections:

* 'Interviews' - This is where I talk about and show the interviews I held with
  my target audience.
* 'The End User (Stakeholders)' - This is where I describe who the stakeholders
  in the project are and what their different use cases may be.
* 'The Focus Group' - This is where I talk about who I have selected to be in my
  focus group. This group will aid in decision making and give me feedback
  during development.
* 'Research into Existing Systems' - This is where I research into and comment
  on existing systems that are similar to what I want to build. I also talk
  about the features that I will borrow from these existing systems.
