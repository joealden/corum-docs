# Limitations of the Project

## Account Recovery

If the user losses their email / password, they will not be able to recover it.
I am deciding not to include this feature, as this version of Corum is only a
prototype, and the creation of this feature is not essential, and it would take
quite a lot of time to get working.

## Responsive CSS

Having responsive CSS would mean that the site would look good on both desktop
and mobile devices. As mentioned, this is just a prototype version of the site,
and as it is only a visual problem, it would be unwise to spend a lot of time
making it look good on mobile devices.
