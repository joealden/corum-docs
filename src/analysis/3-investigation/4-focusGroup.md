# The Focus Group

The focus group will consist of people I know that regularly use sites such as
reddit, and of those that only use such sites for information gathering. This
means that the focus group will contains the two possible types of end users as
mentioned in the previous section. I will use this group for testing and
feedback on Corum as it develops. The group will contains people of a wide age
range, to most accurately represent the end users, as Corum is not aimed at any
particular age group.
