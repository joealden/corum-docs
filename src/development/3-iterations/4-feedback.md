# User and Stakeholder Feedback

During the development of Corum it was important that I communicated with my
stakeholders as often as I could to get feedback on what I was working on at the
time. This is because I am building a piece of software that will be used by my
stakeholders so it is important that they like it. This was also important
because when I was implementing Corum I realised that I had not gathered enough
information from my stakeholders on certain things. For example, I had to
consult with my stakeholder a lot when deciding how the post page should be
layed out. This was done by showing them what I had done so far and then getting
their feedback on what they think might work better.
