This meant implementing the following: The Header component changes state on login The Navigation component loads in all subforums and changes on login state The signup page creates a user and logs them in (with validation) The login page logs a user in if their details are correct (with validation) The subforum page loads the posts from the correct subforum The post page loads post details (name, author, content, comments etc.) The new post page creates a new post and redirects the user to the new post The new subforum page creates a new subforum and updates the navigation This was all made pretty easy because of graphql-playground . It meant that I could construct the queries and mutations for the client in graphql-playground , then once I knew that they did what I wanted them to do I just converted these queries and mutations into JavaScript code. This meant that I could be confident that the frontend was fetching the correct data from the API. As this was the final iteration stage it meant that I could test everything just by visiting the site in a web browser and checking that everything worked correctly as set out in Corum's success criteria.

If you haven't heard of GraphQL before, putting it very simply, it is a more flexible and powerful alternative to REST style APIs. Some of the reasons I am using GraphQL to develop my API over REST are: It allows the server to define what data the client can access, and then the client can choose the information it wants This is unlike REST APIs, as they usually define API endpoints that are for a single client (For example, the mobile site only) The way GraphQL is designed allows for a large tooling eco-system to be built around it For example, I will be using a GraphQL Client library called Apollo that does things like caching and fetching automatically It is easier for the server to add and remove data that clients can access without breaking existing client that depend on it If you would like to find out more about GraphQL, I recommend the following site as a good resource to get started. ( howtographql.com ) To more quickly develop a production standard GraphQL API, I will be using a framework called Graphcool. The framework abstracts away some of the complexity that comes with developing a GraphQL API, such as database management, data access permissions etc. The best feature of graphcool is that is automatically generated a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) interface to the schema defined. This is very much like how an SQL database works, however instead of using SQL, we use GraphQL to define what data we want. This allows me to declaratively design my API, without having to think that much about how everything works under the hood. As well as abstracting away complexity, graphcool allows you to easily extend its capabilities. For example, I will extend graphcool to do things such as create and authorize users, initialize data so that the client doesn't have to, (E.G. Set vote count of a new post to 0 automatically) and do some validation on the data. (E.G. Ensure a user can only vote once on a single post) For more information about graphcool, visit there website here.

This is because the web has become more than just static web pages, but the underlying APIs have not changed all that much. These libraries and frameworks make the job of a web developer easier. For now I will be focusing on the libraries that make building the user interface easier. They do this by abstracting away operations such as manually manipulating the DOM (Through something called a virtual DOM) as well as providing reactive rendering capabilities amongst other things. This improves the developer experience (DX) considerably, as user interfaces can be created declaratively. This means that instead of saying how to do something, (Like manually manipulating the DOM) you just say what you want to happen. This makes the code easier to reason about. The two most popular view libraries today are React and Vue. They both provide the same basic set of features, but they expose these features to the developer in very different ways. This means that the decision is almost entirely down to personal preference. I have experience with both of these libraries and in their current state I prefer Vue. Vue provides a way of building UI components in a .vue file. These files are known as 'Single File Components'. (SFCs) These files allow you to declaratively write a components markup (HTML), logic (JavaScript) and styling (CSS). This provides excellent DX as you only have to view a single file to understand the entire component. This is an abstraction that React doesn't provide, as it one of the contributing factors to why I prefer Vue over React. When I started developing the client side of Corum, I actually started using React. I migrated to Vue because I felt it was more intuitive and less verbose.","title":"Why use Vue?","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Structure of Corum » Why use Vue?"},"design/6-testing/5-automation.html#automated-testing":{"id":"design/6-testing/5-automation.html#automated-testing","title":"Automated Testing","breadcrumbs":"Design » Testing » Automated Testing","body":"These are the following types of tests I will write: Unit Tests Integration Tests End to End Tests (e2e) I will be using the following software to automate my testing: Jest (For unit and integration testing) Cypress (For e2e testing) The following subsections will describe what each of these types of test are, and examples of where they could be used."},"development/6-codeAnalysis/3-api.html#signup":{"id":"development/6-codeAnalysis/3-api.html#signup","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Code Analysis » signup","title":"signup","body":"import { fromEvent } from 'graphcool-lib'\nimport * as bcryptjs from 'bcryptjs'\nimport * as validator from 'validator'\nimport { makeRequest } from '../../utils/common' const userQuery = ` query UserQuery($email: String!, $username: String!) { allUsers(filter: { OR: [{ email: $email }, { username: $username }] }) { id email username } }\n` const createUserMutation = ` mutation CreateUserMutation( $username: String! $email: String! $passwordHash: String! ) { createUser(username: $username, email: $email, password: $passwordHash) { id } }\n` export default async event => { try { // Create Graphcool API (based on https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-request) const graphcool = fromEvent(event) const api = graphcool.api('simple/v1') // Retrieve payload from event const { username, email, password } = event.data // Check is email is valid if (validator.isEmail(email) === false) { return { error: 'The email address entered is not valid' } } // Fetch all users that match the users input (if any) const { allUsers } = await makeRequest(api, userQuery, { email, username }) // If no users exists with the same details, create the user if (allUsers.length === 0) { const SALT_ROUNDS = 10 // Generate the password hash that will be stored in the DB const passwordHash = await bcryptjs.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS) // Create the user const { createUser } = await makeRequest(api, createUserMutation, { email, username, passwordHash }) // Generate auth token const { id } = createUser const token = await graphcool.generateAuthToken(id, 'User') // Return the payload the user asked for return { data: { id, token } } } // If any users do exist, throw the correct informative error if ( allUsers.length === 2 || (allUsers[0].email === email && allUsers[0].username === username) ) { return { error: 'The email address and username are in use' } } else if (allUsers[0].email === email) { return { error: 'The email address is in use' } } else if (allUsers[0].username === username) { return { error: 'The username is in use' } } else { return { error: 'An unknown error occurred' } } } catch (error) { return { error } }\n} This is the resolver that is used to create a new user account. Variable Reference: event this is an object containing all of the information about the query or mutation event we are hooking into. fromEvent is a function exposed by the library graphcool-lib that constructs a GraphQL client from the event data passed into the function. This allows us to send queries and mutations to the API from within the API code. makeRequest is an abstraction of a function provided by graphcool-lib that allows us to send queries and mutations to the API. The exact implementation of this function is described later on. bcryptjs is a hashing library implementing the bcrypt hashing function design. In this resolver, only the hash function exposed by it is used. The use of this function will explained below. validator is a library that can validate many types of data such as emails, passwords, credit card numbers etc. In this resolver, only the isEmail function is used. userQuery is a GraphQL query that fetches a users details. (Their account ID, email and username) createUserMutation is a GraphQL mutation that creates a user. Like the first hook function shown in this section, this function imports what it needs and exports a function for graphcool. Also like the hook functions, a reference to the API is created and the user data is extracted. This time, username , email and password are extracted from the data object. Next, using the isEmail function found in the validator library, the email the user entered is checked to be valid. Internally, the isEmail function is probably using regular expressions to ensure that it contains things such as an @ symbol etc. The isEmail function returns a boolean value. If it returns true , the email passed to it is valid. If it returns false , the email passed to it is not valid. In this case, an error is returned telling the user that ' The email address entered is not valid '. Next, a request is made using the userQuery query passing in the email and username the user entered. This will return an array of User objects that have either the same email or username that the user inputted. If the array returned is empty, (length equals 0) then no users exists with either the same email or username. This means that a new account can be created with these details. First, a variable called SALT_ROUNDS is initialised to the value 10 . This is created because the bcrypt hashing function has a built in salt. This is helpful for security reasons as it means that passwords hashed with bcrypt can easily be protected against rainbow table attacks. Then the hash is created from the password with the hash function. This expects two arguments. The first argument being the string to hash, and the second being the number of times to run the salt. Once the function finishes, the function returns the hash. Next, a request is made using the createUserMutation mutation passing in the email and the username the user entered, as well as the newly created password hash. This mutation will create a new user record with these details. After that, we extract the user's ID from the above mutation response. Then we generate an authentication token for the user using the generateAuthToken on the graphcool object that was created using the fromEvent function earlier. This token will allow the user perform protected actions such as creating posts etc. Then finally, we return the data the user wanted. In the case that the array returned from the userQuery request is not empty, this means that a user exists with some of the same data the user entered. In order to return a useful error message to the user, a few checks are made. These checks are pretty self explanatory, however, I will list the cases that these checks cover: When both the username and password are in use, then the following could be possible: There are 2 separate accounts, one with the same email and another with the same username There is 1 account with the same email and the same username When only the email is in use, there could only be 1 account with the same email When only the username is in use, there could only be 1 account with the same username There is also an else statement at the end in case something that I haven't thought of occurs Also, if any other error occurred in the function, this is caught with the surrounding try / catch statement, then returned to the user."},"development/2-structure/4-api.html#how-graphcool-works":{"breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Structure of Corum » How Graphcool Works","title":"How Graphcool Works","body":"The Command Line Interface (CLI) Like Nuxt, Graphcool provides a CLI (called gcf ) that expose two important commands: gcf deploy This command deploys the API to one of the available public Graphcool servers. Under the hood, graphcool reads a file named graphcool.yml and builds the API using it, then it sends this build bundle up to the server. gcf playground This commands opens a web browser at the URL of the deployed service and lets you explore and test your API. Configuring Graphcool When running the gcf deploy command, Graphcool looks and reads a file named graphcool.yml . This file contains all of the information Graphcool needs to create the API server. The following sub sections will described what each top level property does. For brevity, the entire contents of Corum's graphcool.yml file is not shown in the code analysis section, however, like anything in Corum, the full file can be found at the projects Github repository. types This property expects a string containing the relative path of the .graphql file that contains the API schema. This file must be write in the Schema Definition Language (SDL) that is part of the official GraphQL specification. functions This is where you specify custom resolvers and hook functions that are needed for the API. The property expects an array of objects that describe what the function does and where to find the code for it. Every function object should have a type and a handler property. The type property is used to tell Graphcool if the function is a resolver or a hook function. The handler property tells Graphcool where to find the code for the function. If the type of the function is a resolver, the function object should also specify a schema string that points to the file that contains what data types the resolver should expect and what data types it should return. If the type of the function is a hook function, the function object should also specify a operation property. This expect a string that tells Graphcool what data type and what CRUD operation to trigger on. For example, Corum has a simple hook function that initializes the vote count of a post to 0 when it is created. The operation property of this hook function is Post.create . rootTokens The property expects an array of strings. Each string should map to an existing function that was defined in the functions property. If the function is listed under this property, the function is given the highest level of permissions (Also known as root). This allows the functions to perform queries and mutations to the API that even authenticated users cannot such as getting the password hash for a user. This is needed because functions such as the login resolver need to access this kind of sensitive data to work. permissions As the permissions section of the graphcool.yml file is explained in the code analysis section, I will not repeat the same information. For this reason, look at the code analysis section for an explanation of how permissions work.","id":"development/2-structure/4-api.html#how-graphcool-works"},"analysis/4-analysis/6-hardwareSoftware.html#software":{"body":"As Corum is a website, any modern browser on any modern Operating System will work.

As evident from the above sections, this is usually a good thing. However, when a configuration file is the same between services, there is little you can do to deduplicate and share them. The tool that I ran into configuration problems because of this is called 'prettier'. Prettier is a tool that automatically formats you code to conform to an opinionated style guide that they determine. This is incredibly useful as it means that code styling is kept consistent and I don't have to spend any time formatting the code manually. Prettier does allow some configuration for controversial styling decisions. For example, I like indenting with 2 spaces, I prefer writing JavaScript without semicolons, and I prefer strings in JavaScript to be written only using single quotes. To keep both projects consistent, I want to have the same styling in both the client and the API code. To achieve this consistency I need to have two identical configuration files in each service directory. The issue with this is that if I want to make a change to my prettier configuration I have to remember to change it in both services.

There is no higher authority that makes decisions. In the case of a forum site, this means that it is solely up to the users of the forum as a collective to decide what content belongs on it. Corum will be designed and developed from the ground up to strictly follow this principle. Users will be given one vote each on every post, and each vote will be treated equally. Up until now, this sounds very similar to Reddit . The way that Corum differentiates itself from existing solutions like Reddit is by making the vote that users are given actually mean something. If users generally vote positively on a post, then the post will remain. However, if a post gets a mostly negative response, it will be automatically removed from the sub forum that it was posted in. This means that if someone posts something that doesn't belong on the forum, it will be removed by the users themselves fairly . This is instead of having a moderator remove it based on their own opinion of the post, which could be biased. The idea of having self governing forum software means that the role of the forum moderator no longer needs to exist. This is a good thing because: It means that the forum requires less maintenance. (Less man power required) The users of the forum are responsible for maintaining it. (More neutral and fair ) The removal of the moderator role keeps code complexity down.

Also, Apollo Client provides built in support for caching. This is good for the reason stated above in the graphql-request sub section above. The way this works in Apollo is described in the code analysis section of this report. Another nicety that Apollo Client provides is the concept of middleware hooks. In simple terms, middleware hooks allows the developer to execute arbitrary code and to modify the data that passes through the library on a request or response. This concept is used within Corum to add an Authorization header to every HTTP request sent to the API server (If the user is logged in).

These buttons are bound to onClick event handlers called upvoteButtonClick and downvoteButtonClick respectively. I am only explaining how the upvoteButtonClick handler works as the downvoteButtonClick handler is very similar, it just works in the opposite way. (For example, if the button is pressed, then a downvote will be registered instead of an upvote) Variable Reference: this.voteInProgress ensures that only a single vote is being processed at a time. this.upvoted keeps track of if the user has already upvoted the post this.downvoted keeps track of if the user has already downvoted the post this.localVote keeps track of the local vote count, this variable is needed because any data fetched from the API is immutable. If Corum relied on the data coming from the server only, then the UI would be slow to update, because an response from the API would be required to update the vote count displayed to the user this.createVote , this.updateVote and this.deleteVote are functions that send mutations requests to the API, these functions are described in the next code analysis sub section. This functionality is extracted out of the button click handler functions to reduce code duplication and keep the event handlers easier to read at a glance. Firstly, a check is made to ensure that no vote mutations are in progress. If any are in progress, then the button click is ignored. The reasoning behind this check is explain in the variable reference section above. If the check passes, then the vote mutation starts to execute. To ensure that the user cannot vote again before the function has finished executing, this.voteInProgress is set to true . This function needed to handle the following scenarios: If the user hasn't voted already, increment the vote count on the post by 1 If the user has already upvoted the post, decrement the vote count by 1 If the user has already downvoted the post, increment the vote count by 2 This means that the function needs to handles the 3 possible branches, and execute the correct code.","id":"development/6-codeAnalysis/2-client.html#upvotebuttonclick"},"development/3-iterations/3-changes.html#implementing-a-dumb-frontend-stage-1":{"id":"development/3-iterations/3-changes.html#implementing-a-dumb-frontend-stage-1","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Iteration Stages » Implementing a Dumb Frontend (Stage 1)","body":"First of all I needed to develop a dumb frontend for the site.

For example, you can list the project's name, version, author and it's dependencies. This information is used by tools that will be explained soon. To automate some of the tasks that I do often, I use something called a task runner. The task runner I am using for corum is called NPM scripts, and it comes with my package manager by default. I could have used a different task runner such as gulp but it would have introduced more complexity to the project for not much gain. All NPM scripts does is run the commands that you specify with a few nice features. The way you configure NPM scripts is by adding a \"scripts\" field to package.json . Here is a simple example: { \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"node .\", \"test\": \"jest\", \"deploy\": \"yarn test && yarn start\" }\n} In this contrived example, the usefulness of NPM scripts is not very evident at first glance. Here is what each of these scripts do and how they show the usefulness of NPM scripts when building coding in JavaScript: \"start\" Runs the file named index.js in the root of the project. In practice, this could be used to start something like a web server. Also in practice this command could be a lot more complicated, for example command line flags could be passed to alter how the program runs. This shows one of the benefits of using scripts. The user only has to type a short command such as yarn start to run an arbitrarily long command. This reduces both time taken to execute a task as well as making it so the developer doesn't have to remember a long command every time they want to run it. \"test\" Runs tests using a testing framework called 'jest'. The testing library would be installed as a local dependency to the project, meaning that if the user just typed jest into their command line, it would return an error because the command isn't available in the global context. (Unless they explicitly installed it globally on their system which wouldn't make the project very portable) What NPM scripts is doing is adding the path ' ./node_modules/.bin ' to its PATH environment variable. (This is how it work on Unix like system at least) If NPM scripts didn't add this path, then user would have to write ./node_modules/.bin/jest instead of just jest . This NPM scripts feature makes it a lot easier to write concise, portable scripts. \"deploy\" Runs both the \"test\" and \"start\" scripts one after each other. In this case I am using yarn to execute the scripts, but NPM would also work. ( \"deploy\": \"npm run test && npm run start\" ) What this script shows is that you can compose scripts together. This is useful because it means that individual scripts can be reused and it can abstract the implementation of the scripts away. For example, it is quite evident that the deploy script tests and starts the project just from the names of the scripts it is running. The Problem From the sections above, I hope you can see why NPM scripts are very useful in any type of JavaScript project. The problem is that when there are a lot of scripts, it is a lot harder to reason about them when reading package.json . This issue showed itself when developing Corum as a monolith system as I had scripts for both the client and the API in the same file and sometimes I wanted to call the scripts by the same name. For example, I wanted a \"start\" script for both the client and the API. The client one would start the production ready web server and the API one would start a production ready docker cluster running the backing database and the graphcool service. Because you can't have multiple scripts with the same name for obvious reasons, I had to start prefixing scripts with what part of the system it started. For example, I had scripts called \"client:start\" and \"api:start\" as well as \"client:test\" and \"api:test\" . This was fine for a few scripts but it got out of hand as more scripts were added. When switching to a micro service architecture, there was a separate package.json file for the client and the API. This meant that I could get rid of the prefixes that I had given to most scripts. This in turn made it a lot easier to understand the file and the scripts that could be run at a glance. Dependency and Bundling Issue JavaScript handles dependencies in the following way: The file package.json contains information about the project An important piece of information is the project dependencies When installing the dependencies, (with the yarn command) they are placed in the node_modules folder The API framework I am using, (graphcool) currently bundles the entire contents of the node_modules folder with the deployed code. This means that when the project was a monolith, all of the dependencies for the client were also being bundled with the API code. This was an issue for the following reasons: The API would take up more storage space on the deployed server It would take significantly more time to bundle the API before it was deployed. This meant that I was wasting time. By switching to a micro service architecture, the client and the API had separate dependencies, and therefore had separate node_modules directories. This meant that graphcool was only bundling the code that it needed to. This did indeed reduce the amount of storage space the API service used as well as reduced the built time of the API service considerably. (From about around 30 seconds to roughly 5 seconds, a 600% decrease) This reduced built time meant that I could spend more time coding rather than waiting around.","title":"package.json File"},"analysis/2-idea/4-openPlatform.html#an-open-platform":{"breadcrumbs":"Analysis » The Idea » An Open Platform","body":"While it is one thing to keep the platform itself democratic, it is also important that the management and development is kept democratic as well.

The reason Corum needs a global state management library is because the user details need to be available across the entire app. Instead of calling out to the localStorage API every time Corum needs the user information, it is quicker to keep this information in memory. Nuxt expects this file to export a function that returns the store to use in the application. the Store class is exposed by the Vuex library, and expect a configuration object as a parameter. This object can contain many properties, but I will only explain the ones that I am using. strict - As explained in the comment in the code block, if set to true , this prevents the state from being changed directly without using the methods defined in the mutations property. state - This is an object that is used to initialise the state. Corum only uses two state properties, userId and username . mutations - This is a object of functions that can be called to mutate the state object, as well as perform other operations, such as setting or removing data from the browsers localStorage . There are three mutation methods in Corum's store. logout , saveUserData and updateUserState . logout removes saved data from the browsers localStorage as well as from the store. This mutation is called when the logout button is pressed in the sites header. saveUserData updates the browsers localStorage and the store with the data passed in. This mutation is called when logging the user into the site, or after a user signs up (As it also logs them in). updateUserState updates the state by fetching the data from the browser's localStorage . This is needed as localStorage persists in the browser across visits, whereas Corum's global state cannot persist. Upon every visit, this mutation is called.

This was because I didn't have to think as much about if a configuration setting would cause a conflict. Configuration files were also a lot shorter, so therefore more understandable at a glance. In the following sub sections I will give concrete examples of where switching to a micro service architecture made configuring my tools easier. ESLint (My Linter) For example, the configuration for ESLint (My linter of choice) that I am using is different for the client and the API. This is because the two run in different environments. The client code runs in the browser and the API code runs on the server. (In the node.js runtime) While browsers and node.js both use JavaScript, they support a different set of features as well as exposing different global variables. For example, if I tried to use node's CommonJS ' require ' syntax (used to import files into the current file scope) in the browser, an error would be thrown because there is no global called ' require '. Likewise, if I tried to reference the ' document ' browser global in a node environment, an error would also be thrown. This relates to linting because if I was create Corum as a monolith, the ESLint config would have to be quite permissive, where syntax and globals valid in both environments would be allowed. This would have reduced the effectiveness of the linter because if I did make a mistake like the two mentioned above, it wouldn't be picked up by the linter. This would mean that I would only find this bug at runtime, meaning that I would have wasted time that wouldn't have been wasted if I had a stricter linter configuration. The problem could be mitigated slightly by having separate directories for both the client and server, then creating a config file per directory. This would allow for stricter linting, however it would mean that my editor would not be able to recognise the configuration file. This means that I wouldn't get the errors showing in my editor, and I would have to instead rely on running the linter from the command line. Also, if I wanted to work on both projects at the same time, I would have to start two instances of the linter for each directory. This problem wasn't present when I switch over to a micro service architecture. This was because I could have two separate config files at the root of each service. This means that my editor correctly picks up both the config files and I could still have strict configs for the different services.","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Structure of Corum » Configuration is Made Easier","id":"development/2-structure/2-monolithMicro.html#configuration-is-made-easier","title":"Configuration is Made Easier"},"evaluation/2-testing/5-subforum.html#empty-subforum-message":{"body":"Display a message when a subforum has no posts Location: images/gifs/subforum/empty.gif Empty subforum message GIF","breadcrumbs":"Evaluation » Testing » Empty Subforum Message","id":"evaluation/2-testing/5-subforum.html#empty-subforum-message","title":"Empty Subforum Message"},"design/6-testing/5-automation.html#integration-testing":{"title":"Integration Testing","id":"design/6-testing/5-automation.html#integration-testing","breadcrumbs":"Design » Testing » Integration Testing","body":"While unit testing is testing in isolation, integration testing is testing that units work together.

Also, it would have been almost impossible to develop the entire frontend before I have implemented the API as I would have had nothing to connect the client to. The first stage was to implement the frontend code up to the point until it needed to interface with the API. This meant doing things like working out where things should go on each page and what they should look like. The second stage was to implement the API. This included writing the code for the signup and login resolvers. Due to the fact that the API and the frontend are independent services I did not need to think that much about the implications of the API design might have on the frontend. The third stage was to connect the client to the API. This involved writing the code that made queries to the API and made mutations to the data. For example on the signup page, when the user pressed submit, the frontend needed to send a mutation to the API in order to create the account. I also needed to handle how the frontend would handle the data returned from the API, for example if there was an error (Maybe the email address the user entered is already being used).

Now that we know a user with either the same email address or username doesn't exist, we can start creating the account. First, we need to hash and salt the password before storing it, as storing password in plain text isn't a good idea for obvious reasons. Next, the user details actually need to be stored on the server, so a new User type is created.

Some of the most commonly used build tools such as webpack are renown for there fine control configuration. This is good because it allows the developer to really customise the tools if they want to. However most of the time developers don't need as fine grain control and just want something that works without spending a lot of time setting it up. Two very common tools that are used are 'Babel' and 'Webpack'. Babel This is what Babel has to say for itself on their website: Babel is a JavaScript compiler. Use next generation JavaScript, today. This means that you can write modern JavaScript and have it compiled down into code that can be understood by older browsers and node.js versions. This is great because it means that you don't have to bring your developer experience down to accommodate for the lowest common denominator. Babel can be configured a lot. You can choose what syntax to support and what version of ECMAScript to compile down to. For example, with the babel-preset-env preset you can choose how many previous browser versions to support. Webpack Webpack is the most commonly used module bundler for JavaScript projects at this moment in time. Webpack is a tool that takes an entry point, creates a dependencies tree, and bundles it to an output depending on how it is configured. Webpack's documentation puts it like this: It recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs, then packages all of those modules into one or more bundles. This sounds very abstract because Webpack is capable of a lot and is incredibly configurable. Through the concept known as 'loaders', different types of modules (For example, .js , .css or .vue files) can be processed in a different way. An example of a loader that would be used in conjunction with babel is babel-loader . When configured to run against .js modules, this loader will run babel on every one of them. Another example that would be used with Vue SFCs would be vue-loader . When configured to run against .vue modules, this loader will convert it into a module that can be understood by the browser, as no browsers understand the .vue extension. Through the concept known as 'plugins', tasks can be ran that are not module specific, such as code optimisation and minification. An example of a plugin used commonly is called DefinePlugin . This plugin allows you to configure global constants at compile time. This could be useful when you need to include something like a build version in your final bundle. What Nuxt does for You As evident from the above sections on Babel and Webpack, both of these tools are very configurable. This can be an issue when you just want to start a project and don't need to have fine grain control of the build tools. This can be achieved by either copying a lot of boilerplate configuration code (which is far from ideal) or using a framework like Nuxt that abstracts away the configuration into the framework itself. Nuxt provides sane defaults for both Babel and Webpack in the context of building a Vue project. This brings the best of both worlds as the framework makes it easier to get started by providing sane defaults and it also makes it easy to configure the underlying tools if you need to. Nuxt provides the following out of the box: The ability to write .vue SFCs (It configures Webpack to use vue-loader ) Automatic code splitting (It configures a Webpack plugin to do this work) Transpiles ES6+ syntax (It configures Webpack to use babel-loader ) CSS pre-processor support (It configures Webpack to use a few CSS loaders) Bundles and minifies (It configures multiple Webpack plugins to do this work) Routing and State Management is Baked in While Vue is an excellent view library, it is just that, a view library. This is a good thing because it does one job and does it well. However, it would be nice if one could extend Vue's functionality to provide more than just a view layer. The developers of Vue thought of this and provided a way to do so through what are known as 'Vue plugins'. While there are many plugins available, both official and non-official, I am only interested in two for Corum. These are both official plugins created and maintained by the Vue core team. They are called vue-router and vuex . vue-router provides a client side routing system where the developer can specify routes as Vue components and link between them easily. Without client side routing the routing would have to be done server side. The benefits of client side routing are talked about in the 'Route Design' sub-section of the design section of the report. vuex provides global state management to the application. This is needed for an application like Corum where different components (and often pages) need to be able to access to the same data. This is made even better by the fact that the global data store is reactive. This means that components can subscribe to the store and be notified when the data they want changes. This is useful in many situations. An example in Corum would be where the login page updates the user's login state, and components and pages need to display different information depending on if the user is logged in or not. For example, the header component of the UI needs to update to display a logout button if the user logs in. The issue is that if I want to use these plugins in my code, I have to write a lot of configuration and boilerplate code to get them working at all. Nuxt provides both routing and state management based on vue-router and vuex out of the box. This means that Nuxt handles all of the configuration and means that I don't have to write boilerplate code that makes my code harder to reason about. Nuxt also makes routing file based instead of it being done through a configuration file. How this works is explained in the below 'How Nuxt Works' section. Server Side Rendering without the Hassle In applications built with libraries like Vue, the majority of the markup is generated on the client side after the initial HTML page has been loaded. For example, you might send a HTML document that looks like this: <!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head> <title>React or Vue Application</title>\n</head>\n<body> <div id=\"root\"></div> <script src=\"bundle.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html> At the end of the body element is a script tag that loads a file called 'bundle.js'. This file will contain the the Vue runtime as well as all of the files that you as a developer created. Given the element selector that the developer passed to Vue (In this case #root ), Vue will mount itself at that location. From there, Vue will add and remove elements to and from the DOM. While this is all happening, all the user is seeing is a blank page. The issue is that the time that the page is blank can be quite long depending on the users hardware. This is because the device has to parse and execute the JavaScript in bundle.js before any visible markup is added to the DOM by Vue. Another issue is that some search engines that use crawlers don't execute JavaScript. This means that all the crawler will see is the above HTML and nothing more. This could severely hurt the SEO of the site on certain search engines. Some users also choose not to execute unknown JavaScript code by changing a setting in their browser. Just like the crawler, these users will not see anything on the page. The way to solve this is to use a technique known as Server Side Rendering (SSR). When SSR is implemented, the server goes through a similar process to the one above that happens on the client and saves the markup outputted by Vue. This markup is then what is sent to the user instead of just the application skeleton shown above. The SSR version of the code above might look something like this: <!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head> <title>React or Vue Application</title>\n</head>\n<body> <div id=\"root\"> <main> <h1>Home Page</h1> <p>This is the home page.</p> </main> </div> <script src=\"bundle.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html> Here you can see that the element that Vue mounts to ( #root ) contains some markup when it is returned from the server. This means that as soon as the page is parsed and loaded, the user will be able to see the markup. This means that the initial perceived load time is faster. It also means that SEO is better as the search engine crawlers that don't execute JavaScript can now see the correct markup, as well as those users that have JavaScript disabled. At the end of the body there is still a script tag that loads bundle.js . This time bundle.js contains JavaScript that performs an action known as 'hydrating'. This is where Vue checks the markup inside the mounting element and compares it to the markup that it would have inserted there. If they match, Vue can be sure that the page has rendered correctly and can perform its reactive updates when needed. After this process has finished, the site acts just like it would when SSR was not being used. Module System Nuxt also provides a 'module system'. This is similar to the Webpack plugin system where developers can extend the functionality of the tool. This also means that developers can publish Nuxt modules to be downloaded by others. In the below section named 'How Nuxt Works' there is a sub section on what modules Corum uses."},"analysis/3-investigation/2-interviews.html#insights-gained-from-these-interviews":{"body":"As a summary from these interview responses, I can tell the following: People like how the Reddit voting system works People want a more modern version of Reddit (Like a web app) People dont like how cluttered Reddit's UI is People like the idea of Reddit, but think it could be executed better I will take these interviews responses into account when designing and developing Corum.","breadcrumbs":"Analysis » The Investigation » Insights Gained from these Interviews","id":"analysis/3-investigation/2-interviews.html#insights-gained-from-these-interviews","title":"Insights Gained from these Interviews"},"development/3-iterations/3-changes.html#iteration-stages":{"body":"","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Iteration Stages » Iteration Stages","title":"Iteration Stages","id":"development/3-iterations/3-changes.html#iteration-stages"},"analysis/2-idea/2-redditAlternative.html#a-reddit-alternative":{"title":"A Reddit Alternative","breadcrumbs":"Analysis » The Idea » A Reddit Alternative","body":"If you do not already know what Reddit is, this section will explain the basic premise behind it.

Submissions with the most up-votes appear on the front page or the top of a category. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called \"subreddits\". Corum will borrow these basic ideas.

As mentioned before, Apollo is used to communicate with Corum's GraphQL API. Before Apollo can communicate the with the API, it needs to be configured. In version 2 of Apollo Client, it was made a lot more modular. The two important things to configure now are Apollo Links and Caches. Apollo Links allow you to configure how GraphQL queries are handled. A common Apollo link is apollo-link-http as seen below. This allows you to configure how queries are sent over HTTP. The apollo-link-http package exposes a class called HttpLink . As seen below, it expects and object containing the uri of the API server. In Corum's case, the API endpoint address is fetched from the .env file located in the root directory of the project. This means that queries sent through Apollo are now sent to our Graphcool API. There is also a generic Apollo link in the package apollo-link . This package exposes a class called ApolloLink . This link allows you to modify the request before it is sent in any way you like. (Also known as middleware) The reason Corum needs to modify the request is so that the authentication token (if present) is sent along with the request, allowing protected queries to be performed. (Such as creating posts) The authentication token is fetched when the user is logged in, and it is checked by the API before any protected queries are performed, so it ensures that only logged in users can perform protected queries. Apollo Caches are used to cache data fetched from the server, so that unneeded network requests are not made. How this works is that Apollo checks the cache before following the Apollo Link chain. A type of Apollo Cache called apollo-cache-inmemory is used by corum. This simply means that the cache is kept in memory on the client, so it is deleted when the user goes off of the site.","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Code Analysis » Apollo Configuration","title":"Apollo Configuration"},"evaluation/2-testing/4-navigation.html#search-functionality-works":{"id":"evaluation/2-testing/4-navigation.html#search-functionality-works","body":"The 'All Subforums' list is filtered by the search input The search is case insensitive Mention the filtering code below (Link) When no items match the search term, show a message Location: images/gifs/navigation/search.gif Search Functionality Works GIF If the user is logged in and no items match, show a slightly different message with a link to create a subforum Link to the create a subforum page works Location: images/gifs/navigation/search-logged-in.gif Logged in search message GIF","title":"Search Functionality Works","breadcrumbs":"Evaluation » Testing » Search Functionality Works"},"development/2-structure/3-client.html#configuration":{"breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Structure of Corum » Configuration","title":"Configuration","id":"development/2-structure/3-client.html#configuration","body":"Certain settings for Corum exist in the file named .env at the root of the client project.

Because I was using Graphcool it meant that I didn't need to worry about setting up things like a database or a web sever, Graphcool handled all of that for me by abstracting them away. Instead, I had to think about how the data model defined in the design section of this report would interface with the JavaScript code I needed to write to get functionality like signup and login working. This was done by using hook functions and custom resolvers. The exact code for this iteration stage can be found in the API code analysis section of this report. To test the API I used a tool called graphql-playground . This tool is available standalone but it also comes bundles with Graphcool. This meant that I didn't have to set it up to test the API. When visiting the API endpoint returned by Graphcool in a web browser it displays the graphql-playground interface. This interface allows you to make queries and mutations to the API without writing any code. The following GIF shows how it works.

For example, I needed to implement a hook function that set the initial vote count of every post to 0 to ensure that the client could fake the amount of up-votes a post had. To test this I could simply try all of the different cases that the client code provide: The client doesn't provide a voteCount field: Location: images/gifs/iterations/post-test-1.gif Post Test 1 The client provides voteCount but it is null : Location: images/gifs/iterations/post-test-2.gif Post Test 1 The client provides a voteCount field that is not 0 : Location: images/gifs/iterations/post-test-3.gif Post Test 1 The client provides a voteCount field that is 0 : Location: images/gifs/iterations/post-test-4.gif Post Test 1 As you can see in all of these examples, voteCount is returned as 0 in all cases, as intended."},"evaluation/1-index/index.html#evaluation":{"title":"Evaluation","body":"In this section of the report, I will be doing the following: Doing final testing to ensure success criteria has been met Outlining usability features of Corum Performing a final evaluation of the success of the solution, its limitations, and its possible maintenance issues","breadcrumbs":"Evaluation","id":"evaluation/1-index/index.html#evaluation"},"development/2-structure/4-api.html#why-graphcool":{"breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Structure of Corum » Why Graphcool?","title":"Why Graphcool?","id":"development/2-structure/4-api.html#why-graphcool","body":"Graphcool is like Nuxt for a GraphQL server.

Most of this file is just boilerplate to link the below hook functions into graphcool, however a very important part of this file is the permissions section. This section allows you to define exactly who can do what with the API. This is crucial to the proper functioning of Corum as it stops non authenticated users from doing things like creating posts, creating comments and voting on posts. This configuration file is written in yml . So in this file, permissions is a list of objects. Each object in the permissions array specifies the operation to configure. The operations that can be configured are derived from the API schema. (Linked above) For example, The Vote data type found in the schema can have the following operations configured: Vote.create Vote.read Vote.update Vote.delete These operations are found on every data type in the schema. (Which are CRUD operations) You can also specify permissions for relations. This is important because creating a relationship between data types means that both data type instances are mutated. For example, the following operations can be specified for the UserToPost relation which links a user to the post they created: UserToPost.connect UserToPost.Disconnect If a certain operation is not specified, (for example, there is not Favorite.update operation in this configuration) then nothing (expect hook functions given root tokens) can perform this operation. If an object in the permissions section specifies an authenticated property of true , the operation can only be performed by authenticated users (Users that are logged in) If an object in the permission section specifies a field property, then operation is restricted to only the values found in the array passed to it. For example, in Corum's API, anyone can read from the Username data type, however they can only read the username field.","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Code Analysis » Permission Configuration","id":"development/6-codeAnalysis/3-api.html#permission-configuration"},"evaluation/2-testing/3-login.html#navigating-to-the-signup-page":{"id":"evaluation/2-testing/3-login.html#navigating-to-the-signup-page","body":"The link provided on the login page to the signup page works Location: images/gifs/login/signup-link.gif Navigating to the Signup Page GIF","title":"Navigating to the Signup Page","breadcrumbs":"Evaluation » Testing » Navigating to the Signup Page"},"design/6-testing/4-data.html#creating-a-comment":{"breadcrumbs":"Design » Testing » Creating a Comment","title":"Creating a Comment","body":"To properly test the creation of a comment, I will need to give it data that is varied in length.

(Through the signup resolver) Variable Reference: event this is an object containing all of the information about the query or mutation event we are hooking into. fromEvent is a function exposed by the library graphcool-lib that constructs a GraphQL client from the event data passed into the function. This allows us to send queries and mutations to the API from within the API code. makeRequest is an abstraction of a function provided by graphcool-lib that allows us to send queries and mutations to the API. The exact implementation of this function is described later on. bcryptjs is a hashing library implementing the bcrypt hashing function design. In this resolver, only the compare function exposed by it is used. The use of this function will explained below. userQuery is a GraphQL query that fetches a users details. (Their account ID, username and password) Like the first hook function shown in this section, this function imports what it needs and exports a function for graphcool. Also like the hook functions, a reference to the API is created and the user data is extracted. This time, email and password are extracted from the data object. Next, a request is made using the userQuery query to fetch the users details from the email address the user inputted. When the API responds, a check is made to ensure that a user with the email the user typed in actually exists. If a user doesn't exist, a generic ' Invalid Credentials ' error is thrown. This means that the API sends back this error message to the client for it to display it to the user. If a user does exist with the email the user specified, then we can continue to make further checks. Next, using the bcryptjs.compare function, the password the user entered is checked against the hash that was fetched earlier from the database. The compare function takes two arguments. The first argument being the raw password that hasn't been hashed. The second argument being the password to check against that has been hashed. Internally, the function hashes the password and then compares it against the second argument. If they match, the function will return true , if the hashes don't match, the function will return false . This comparison function is asynchronous, so we must await the return value. Once the function returns the boolean value, another check is made. If the function returned false, meaning the password the user entered wasn't correct, then the same generic ' Invalid Credentials ' error. The reason we throw the same error on both cases is because it makes it harder for an attacker to gain unauthorised accessed to another users account. This is because they can't tell if the user or password is the thing they have got incorrect. If a user exists with both the email and password the user specified, we have a high degree of confidence that the user is who they say they are. This means that we can start to construct the information to return to the user. First, we extract the user's ID and username off of the User object. Then we generate an authentication token for the user using the generateAuthToken on the graphcool object that was created using the fromEvent function earlier. This token will allow the user perform protected actions such as creating posts etc. Then finally, we return the data the user wanted. Also, if any other error occurred in the function, this is caught with the surrounding try / catch statement, then returned to the user.","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Code Analysis » authenticate"},"design/2-gui/index.html#login-page-ui":{"title":"Login Page UI","breadcrumbs":"Design » Login Page UI","body":"Login Page","id":"design/2-gui/index.html#login-page-ui"},"analysis/4-analysis/3-computationalMethods.html#declarative":{"id":"analysis/4-analysis/3-computationalMethods.html#declarative","body":"Vue allow me to develop components as SFCs (Single File Components) This allows me to create my components declaratively and encapsulated, as the HTML, JavaScript and CSS for that particular component will all be contained within the single file.

The Command Line Interface (CLI) Nuxt provides a CLI tool that exposes 3 important commands: nuxt This command starts the Nuxt development server. The following happens in development mode: The server is reloaded every time a file changes Errors are logged to the console and on an overlay These features are useful when developing but are not needed or wanted when deploying the site to production. ##### nuxt build This builds and bundles all of the sites files. This makes it ready to be hosted on the production server. nuxt start This starts the production server. Before executing this command, it is important that the site has been build with the nuxt build command. The following happens in production mode: All errors are suppressed so that it is harder for an attacker to exploit a possible bug the files are minified and optimised. Vue developer tools are disabled for better performance The service worker added by the PWA module is turned on This makes the production site faster and more refined. The Directory Structure Nuxt utilises a file based API system. Each of the following sections explains what each directory means to Nuxt. layouts Nuxt has a concept of 'layouts'. A layout is a Vue SFC that can be used to make multiple pages have the same base layout. When a page is rendered, Nuxt looks at what layout it specifies and then renders the page inside of the specified layout. You can choose where the page renders in the layout using the nuxt Vue component. As mentioned above, pages can say what layout they want to use. This is done in the page's SFC under the \"layout\" property. For example, if a page specified \"layout\": \"test\" then the page would use the test.vue SFC found in the layouts directory. The \"layout\" property defaults to default if it is not otherwise specified. Because Corum has a single consistent layout, only a single default.vue exists. This means that all pages default to use this layout. From the sketch shown in the 'Component Design' sub section of the Design section, it is clear what components should be kept in this file: The Logo component The Header component The Navigation component Then where the Main Content section is in the UI design sketch is where the nuxt Vue component should be used to render the actual page. pages This directory contains all of the sites pages as Vue SFCs. Here is a diagram of the structure of Corum's pages directory: pages\n├── index.vue\n├── login.vue\n├── new-subforum.vue\n├── signup.vue\n└── subforum └── _subforum ├── index.vue ├── new.vue └── post └── _post.vue This directory acts as a file based router. This means that when Nuxt builds the site for either development or production mode, it reads the structure of this directory and creates page accordingly. For example, the index.vue file would map to the route / , the signup.vue file would map to the route /signup and the subforum/_subforum/index.vue would map to the route /subforum/:subforum . From the examples given above, you can see that you can nest directories in the pages directory to create deeper routes. Also, it is important to note that any file prefixed with a _ means that the value of this part of the route is dynamic. For example, in the final example above that maps to /subforum/:subforum , the :subforum part of the route can be any string such as /subforum/programming . The dynamic variable can be accessed from within the pages SFC, meaning that the page can dynamically show different content from the same route depending on the content of the dynamic part of it. If you look back at the 'Route Design' sub section in the Design section of this report, you can see from the diagram above that the files shown map to all of the routes that are needed for Corum. static This directory is a place to store any asset that is linked statically in the site in its HTML. The only thing Corum uses this directory for it to store the favicon of the site. store This directory is used to store JavaScript files that are used to create the global state store using vuex . This directory is optional. If the directory is empty, then Nuxt will intelligently exclude vuex as a dependency, as if the directory is empty, the global state store is not being used, and therefore is not needed. In the context of Corum, only a single index.js file is contained within it. This file creates and exports a store that is used to keep track of the user's data. A detailed explanation of this file can be found in the later sub section named 'Client Analysis'. Nuxt modules used by Corum As mentioned above, Nuxt provides an extension point through the use of 'Nuxt modules'. These are the modules that Corum uses that have been published by others. apollo This will only make complete sense once you have read the section below titled 'Apollo'. In short, this module provides a very simple way to setup the Apollo library that I am using to fetch data from the GraphQL API. dotenv This allows Corum to read in configuration options from a file named .env at the root of the project though a global variable called process.env . There is also a section below that will explain this in more detail named 'Configuration'. font-awesome This module injects a CSS library called 'Font Awesome'. This library provides a large collection of SVG icons that Corum uses. These can be seen in a lot of places, for example in the login and signup buttons. pwa This module provides a zero configuration Progressive Web App experience. This includes things like adding a service worker to the site when in production mode and more. Nuxt Configuration ( nuxt.config.js ) While nuxt provides a great abstraction on top of Vue and related libraries, it is also very customisable and extensible. Nuxt provides a central way to configure itself through a file located at the root of the project called nuxt.config.js . The details of Corum's Nuxt config are explained in the client's code analysis section."},"development/3-iterations/3-changes.html#prototype-1":{"body":"Location: images/gifs/iterations/prototype-1.gif Prototype 1 This was the first iteration milestone that was reached. The goal of this iteration was to implement a dumb frontend. This means that it was just to get the HTML and CSS correct for the basic layout of all pages. All of the components described in the design section of the this report were created and layed out correctly on the page. This stage was very basic, for example the sign-up and login buttons didn't do anything. Also to note is that this prototype was created with React and not Vue, the view library that I ended up using. At the end of this prototype, as explained before, I didn't like how developing Corum in react felt.","title":"Prototype 1","id":"development/3-iterations/3-changes.html#prototype-1","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Iteration Stages » Prototype 1"},"development/6-codeAnalysis/2-client.html#createvote":{"body":"/* For more info on how mutations work within vue-apollo, visit https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo#mutations\n*/ // variables = { vote, postId, userId }\nasync createVote(variables) { const postId = this.$route.params.post try { await this.$apollo.mutate({ mutation: createVoteMutation, variables, update: (store, { data: { createVote } }) => { const data = store.readQuery({ query: userVoteQuery, variables: { postId, userId: this.userId } }) data.allVotes.push({ __typename: 'Vote', id: createVote.id, vote: variables.vote }) store.writeQuery({ query: userVoteQuery, variables: { postId, userId: this.userId }, data }) }, optimisticResponse: { __typename: 'Mutation', createVote: { id: 0, __typename: 'Vote' } } }) // Indicate to the page that the vote has finished execution this.voteInProgress = false } catch (error) { logIfDev('error', error) }\n} Like the upvoteButtonClick and downvoteButtonClick functions, the 3 vote mutation functions createVote , updateVote and deleteVote are very similar. I will only analyse the createVote function. Variable Reference: variables , as mentioned at the top of the code block, is expected to be an object with vote , postId and userId properties. These pieces of data are needed to correctly create the vote this.$apollo is a module exposed by the vue-apollo package I am using for Vue bindings to Apollo. This is available on the global Vue instance, this means that is can be accessed from any .vue file. It exposes as method called mutate that is used to send a mutation to the API createVoteMutation is a GraphQL mutation used to create the user userVoteQuery is a GraphQL query that returns the data for a users vote this.$route.params.post contains the postId that can be seen in the browsers URL bar when on a post page. Like this.$apollo , this.$route is available on the global Vue instance. However, instead of being exposed by vue-apollo , it is exposed by the router, vue-router . The whole function is just a call to the mutate function found on this.$apollo . The mutate function expects an object as an argument. While the object argument can take more properties, these are the properties I am using: mutation - The GraphQL mutation that you want to send to the API variables - An object of variables that the mutation takes in update - The function that is called when data is returned from the API optimisticUpdate - An object that will be used in place of the real data before the data is returned from the API. If this property is present, then the update function passed in will be called twice. Once immediately with the optimisticUpdate object passed as the data parameter of the update function, and then again whenever the data is returned from the API. This means that the UI can be optimistically updated before the real data from the API is returned. Otherwise there would be a delay between pressing the vote button and the UI updating, which would be a bad user experience. To show what the update function does, I will explain what happens when it is called with the optimisticUpdate object. As shown in the update function signature, the function expects the following parameters: store - This object is a reference to the Apollo cache that exists in memory. (That was created by the apollo-cache-inmemory package as seen in the 'Apollo Configuration' sub section) It exposes two methods that I make use of called readQuery and writeQuery . As evident from their names, the readQuery function takes in a query and queries the cache with it. The writeQuery takes a query and the data to be written to the cache. data - In the case of the first call of the update function, this is the optimisticUpdate object. The usual flow of the update function is the following: Read the data from the cache Mutation the read data Write the data back to the cache This function does exactly that. The data is read, the data object is mutated by pushing the new vote onto the end of the allVotes array, then the mutation data object is written back to the cache. Most of the function's body is wrapped in a try / catch statement. This is needed as if any errors occur, the function will gracefully handle them. For example, if the API is not running, then an error will be logged to the console if the app is in development mode, using the logIfDev function that will be explained later on.","title":"createVote","id":"development/6-codeAnalysis/2-client.html#createvote","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Code Analysis » createVote"},"development/6-codeAnalysis/3-api.html#updatevotecountonvotecreation":{"body":"import { fromEvent } from 'graphcool-lib'\nimport { VOTE_COUNT_TO_DELETE_POST, makeRequest, deleteAllVotesOnPost, postIdFromVoteQuery, currentPostVoteCount, getAllVoteIdsOnPost, deleteVote, deletePost, updatePost\n} from '../../utils/common' /* This is a hook function that executes every time after a vote is created.

It updates the voteCount field on the post to reflect the vote creation. Also, if the new vote count is equal or less than the VOTE_COUNT_TO_DELETE_POST constant, then the post will be deleted (The automated management system) As this check has to be made on every possible CRUD operation that may modify the overall vote count, there are also hook functions for when a vote is updated or deleted called updateVoteCountOnVoteUpdate and updateVoteCountOnVoteDeletion respectively. These hook functions are very similar, so I will only be analysing the 'creation' version of the hook functions as shown above. Variable Reference: event this is an object containing all of the information about the query or mutation event we are hooking into. fromEvent is a function exposed by the library graphcool-lib that constructs a GraphQL client from the event data passed into the function. This allows us to send queries and mutations to the API from within the API code. makeRequest is an abstraction of a function provided by graphcool-lib that allows us to send queries and mutations to the API. The exact implementation of this function is described later on. deleteAllVotesOnPost is a function that as the name suggests, deletes all votes on a post. The implementation of this function is described later on. postIdFromVoteQuery is GraphQL query that fetches the post's ID that a vote was made on. currentPostVoteCount is a GraphQL query that fetches the the current vote count of a post. getAllVoteIdsOnPost is a GraphQL query that fetches all votes that exist on a post. deleteVote is a GraphQL mutation that deletes a vote. deletePost is a GraphQL mutation that deletes a post. updatePost is a GraphQL mutation that updates a post with a new post count. Like the first hook function shown in this section, this function imports what it needs and exports a function for graphcool. Also like the first hook function, a reference to the API is created and the user data is extracted. This time, voteId and voteType are extracted from the data object. Next, a request is made to get the post ID using the voteId variable. When the API responds, the post ID fetched is used to fetch the current vote count on that post. Then, depending on how the user voted, (determined by the contents of the voteType variable) A new vote count is created. If the user upvoted the post, the vote count is increment by 1. If the user downvoted the post, the vote count is decremented by 1. There is also error handling if they somehow submitted an incorrect vote type. If voteType was defined, the function continues and goes on to update the post data stored in the database. This is where the automated management system works. If the new vote count is less than or equal to the defined threshold stored in VOTE_COUNT_TO_DELETE_POST , the post is deleted along with all of the votes that were linked to it. Otherwise, the post is updated with the new vote count.","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Code Analysis » updateVoteCountOnVoteCreation","id":"development/6-codeAnalysis/3-api.html#updatevotecountonvotecreation","title":"updateVoteCountOnVoteCreation"},"development/6-codeAnalysis/2-client.html#submitpost":{"breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Code Analysis » submitPost","body":"async submitPost() { const authorId = this.$store.state.userId const { postTitle: title, postContent: content, Subforum: { id } } = this /* For more info on how mutations work within vue-apollo, visit https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo#mutations */ try { const { data: { createPost } } = await this.$apollo.mutate({ mutation: createPostMutation, variables: { authorId, title, content, id } }) const { subforum } = this.$route.params const postId = createPost.id this.$router.push(`/subforum/${subforum}/post/${postId}`) } catch (error) { this.$router.push(`/error`) // TODO: create actual error page }\n} Like the submitComment function, this is also an event handler.

To avoid repetition, I will not explain how this function works again. If you don't know how it works, read the above 'createVote' sub section. This function works in a very similar way to the createVote function. First, the data required for the mutation is saved into local variables. After this, the contents of this.comment is set to an empty string. This is done near the start of the function to keep the UI feeling snappy. Then the mutation is made. The mutation is very similar to the createVote function. The update function pushes the new comment into the post's comments array inside of Apollo's cache. After this has happened, the user is automatically scrolled to the bottom of the page to see that their new comment has appeared in the comments section.

This is required because graphcool doesn't allow you to delete records that would leave other records orphans.

Variable Reference: getAllVoteIdsOnPost is a GraphQL query that gets all the Vote object IDs that are associated with the post specified. It accepts the following arguments: api is a reference to the API object created from the fromEvent function postId is the post's ID to delete the votes on It returns a promise that is resolved with the array of the deleted vote IDs. First, a request is made using the getAllVoteIdsOnPost query passing in postId as the queries variables. As mentioned above, this returns an array of Vote objects each with an id property. Then, using JavaScript built in map method present on the Array prototype, an array is created of just the ID strings. If you do not know what a map function does, it takes an array as input, performs an arbitrary action on each item of the array, and then returns a new array of length. The JavaScript implementation expects a function as input. This function will be executed on each item of the array. To find out more about the map function, visit the MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) website and search for Array.prototype.map . Finally, a call to Promise.all is made. This function takes in an array of promises and returns a promise. The array of promises are executed in parallel, and the promise only resolves when all items in the promise array have resolved. If any of the promises reject, the returned promise will reject with that promises rejection error. To find out more about the map function, visit the MDN website and search for Promise.all . In this function, the array of vote IDs are mapped to an array of promises that will make a request to delete the vote in the database with the corresponding ID. This array is used as the argument to Promise.all . This means that This function will resolve when all of the votes in the array have been deleted.","title":"deleteAllVotesOnPost","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Code Analysis » deleteAllVotesOnPost","id":"development/6-codeAnalysis/3-api.html#deleteallvotesonpost"},"evaluation/2-testing/8-newSubforum.html#new-subforum-page":{"body":"The only way to access this page is through the navigation when a user is logged in Location: images/gifs/new-subforum/index.gif New subforum page GIF If the user tries to create a subforum that already exists, an error occurs Location: images/gifs/new-subforum/exists.gif Subforum already exists GIF If a user tries to visit this page when they are not logged in, an error message is displayed with links to either signup or login Location: images/gifs/new-subforum/error.gif New subforum page error GIF","id":"evaluation/2-testing/8-newSubforum.html#new-subforum-page","breadcrumbs":"Evaluation » Testing » New Subforum Page","title":"New Subforum Page"},"development/1-index/index.html#todo":{"body":"Relate implementation back to design and user requirements Put new subforum page in design In this section of the report, I will be doing the following: Creating a more detailed description of the structure of Corum as a whole Documenting the iterations of the development phase Explaining the problems that I experienced during development Analysing both the client and API code of Corum","breadcrumbs":"TODO","title":"TODO","id":"development/1-index/index.html#todo"},"analysis/4-analysis/6-hardwareSoftware.html#deployment":{"id":"analysis/4-analysis/6-hardwareSoftware.html#deployment","title":"Deployment","body":"To start the production server, run the following commands: yarn\nyarn deploy","breadcrumbs":"Analysis » The Analysis » Deployment"},"analysis/4-analysis/1-index.html#the-analysis":{"breadcrumbs":"Analysis » The Analysis","title":"The Analysis","body":"Placeholder describing what this section of the report does","id":"analysis/4-analysis/1-index.html#the-analysis"},"evaluation/2-testing/2-signup.html#input-validation":{"breadcrumbs":"Evaluation » Testing » Input validation","body":"Mention that the validation code can be found below (maybe link) The Sign Up button can only be pressed when: All fields have been filled The two passwords fields match In this GIF, it can be seen that the passwords do not match, as they of different length Location: images/gifs/signup/input-validation.gif Input validation GIF","id":"evaluation/2-testing/2-signup.html#input-validation","title":"Input validation"},"analysis/3-investigation/5-existingSystems.html#phpbb--open-source":{"body":"Solus' Forum Front Page phpBB has different goals than Corum, Reddit and Hacker News.

This kind of structure is very common when developing with languages such as PHP. This kind of structure is known as a 'monolith system'. This structure has the benefit of being conceptually simpler to think about and easier to actually implement. However, monolith projects do have their drawbacks. It is harder to test conceptually different components of a system as they are typically tightly coupled, and it is harder to make large refactors as the changes might break other parts of the system. Developing in a 'micro service' mindset lends to code being more testable and reusable, as components of a system that are conceptually separate are developed in isolation from each other, meaning that tight coupling of components is avoided at a management level. It also adheres more to the idea of 'separation of concerns', as conceptually in the context of Corum, the API doesn't need any knowledge of the client, it only needs to provide a generic interface to the data the client needs. Another benefit of developing micro services are that the services can be deployed separately, even on different machines. This is a benefit because with a monolith system, if the machine running it fails for whatever reason, and no redundancy is in place, the whole system goes down. The way to provide redundancy to a monolith system is to deploy multiple instances of the whole system, or to boot an instance when another goes down. This could be less than ideal because it may be using more system resources than needed, and it could take longer for the whole system to start up, instead of a single micro service. Deploying micro services means that different parts of the system can be provided redundancy independently of each other. This could mean that less system resources are wasted, and start up times are likely to be faster, meaning that the system is down for a shorter period of time. For these reasons above, I decided, during the development of the project, that I would split the client and the API into separate services.","breadcrumbs":"Implementation » Structure of Corum » At the Start of Development","title":"At the Start of Development","id":"development/2-structure/2-monolithMicro.html#at-the-start-of-development"},"design/2-gui/index.html#gui-design":{"title":"GUI Design","id":"design/2-gui/index.html#gui-design","breadcrumbs":"Design » GUI Design","body":"Here are some sketches that I have created for the GUI of Corum"},"evaluation/4-evaluation/1-index.html#final-evaluation":{"breadcrumbs":"Evaluation » Final Evaluation","title":"Final Evaluation","body":"","id":"evaluation/4-evaluation/1-index.html#final-evaluation"},"design/6-testing/5-automation.html#advantages":{"id":"design/6-testing/5-automation.html#advantages","breadcrumbs":"Design » Testing » Advantages","body":"Tests an entire user story, which means that it is as close to what the user will experience as possible","title":"Advantages"},"development/2-structure/3-client.html#fetching-data-with-apollo":{"body":"As mentioned in the Design section of this report, the API is a GraphQL server. This is instead of a similar comparable technique such as REST. To find out more about the benefits of GraphQL, have a look at the 'API Design' sub section in the Design section. Because the API is a GraphQL server, the client needs a GraphQL client library to communicate with the server. Communication with the server could be done manually with GET and POST JSON requests to the API endpoint, however, just like Vue provides a declarative interface to the DOM, GraphQL clients provide a declarative interface for fetching data. Even though GraphQL is a relatively new technology, there are quite a few clients to choose from. Some libraries target React as it is the most popular view library (Such as urql or relay ).

This page could be accessed in 2 different ways. The first way would be type physically type the path into the web browser's url bar. The second way would be to click on the login button located in the header. This page will display a form to the user to login. For the user to login, they must have first created an account. (Which is done through the signup page) The login form will contain the following: The Corum logo An email address field A password field A login button A message and link directing the user to the signup page if they do not already have an account. The login button will only be enabled (clickable) if both an email address and a password have been supplied. If the user successfully logs in, they will be redirected back to the page they were previously on before visiting the login page. If the user have an unsuccessful login attempt, then the error returned by the GraphQL API will be displayed to the user. After the error has been displayed, the user will be free to try and login again. After the user logs in, the rest of the site will update in response to the state change. (From being logged out to being logged in) These state changes are described in more detail in the Component Design section. This means the following: The header will render a greeting and logout button instead of the signup and login buttons The navigation will render the user's 'favorites' section and the 'all subforums' section instead of just the 'all subforums' section The user will now be allowed to create new posts and comments The user will now be allowed to upvote and downvote posts After the site has updated to be in the 'logged in' state, the user will no longer be able to click on a login button. However, this does not mean they could not access the login page from the other way described above, via the url bar in the browser.

The first way is to navigate to it via the navigation on the left of the site. The second way is for the user to enter the url of a subforum the already know exists (For example, '/subforum/test' ) The way the client knows what subforum to fetch data for is by the path variable :subforum that is in the url. This value can be accessed from within the JavaScript of the page. This page will show the posts that have been posted in the subforum. A visual representation of the following information can also be found in the 'UI Design' section. This is what a subforum page will contain: The title of the subforum A way to sort the posts (Two radio buttons): Sort by most popular posts Sort by newest posts A New Post button that will link to '/subforum/:subforum/new' Headers for each piece of data of a post: The posts title The time and date it was created at The current vote count of the post A list containing the posts associated with the current subforum with the data specified by the headers above Each post will be a linked to '/subforum/:subforum/post/:post' The New Post button will only be enabled (clickable) if the user is logged in, otherwise, it will be greyed out. This is because a user should only be allowed to create a post if they are logged in. Server Side As mentioned before, the GraphQL API exposes automatically generated queries and mutations to perform CRUD operations. One of these exposed queries is called allPosts . If I provide no parameters to the query, it will return every post that exists on the whole site. Two parameters that will be used to fetch the posts for a specific subforums will be the following: filter This expects a data type of 'Subforum' The way I will be filtering the data is by the 'url' field on the 'Subforum' type. This means that only the data that was posted on the subforum will be returned orderBy This an enum called 'PostOrderBy' This enum has values to sort by both descending ('DESC') and ascending ('ASC') of each field of 'Post' The enum values that we are interested in are 'voteCount_DESC' and 'createdAt_DESC' The client will pass the path variable mentioned above ( :subforum ) as the value for filter . By default, the sort will be by vote count ('voteCount_DESC'). When the user switches between the two sort types, the query will be resent to the server with the different enum value. This means that graphcool abstracts away the sorting functionality, meaning that I don't have to implement it myself.","id":"design/5-route/6-subforum.html#subforum-page"},"development/2-structure/4-api.html#graphcool":{"body":"As mentioned before in both the analysis and design sections, I am using the library and service known as Graphcool.

There is also a hook function called userAndPostIsUnique is very similar. Instead of ensuring that only unique favorites can be added, it ensures that only unique votes can be made on a post. As this hook function is so similar, I will only analyse this hook function. Variable Reference: favoriteQuery is the GraphQL query used to check if the user has already favorited of this subforum. event this is an object containing all of the information about the query or mutation event we are hooking into. fromEvent is a function exposed by the library graphcool-lib that constructs a GraphQL client from the event data passed into the function. This allows us to send queries and mutations to the API from within the API code. makeRequest is an abstraction of a function provided by graphcool-lib that allows us to send queries and mutations to the API. The exact implementation of this function is described later on. First, fromEvent and makeRequest are imported so that they can be used in this file. Next, we export a function that expects the event argument. The reason we do this is because graphcool expects hook function files to export a function that it can call when needed. Within this function, using the fromEvent function, a reference to the API is created from the event data and assigned to the variable api . This variable will be passed into the makeRequest function so that it knows what API to make the request to. Next, the data the client submitted to the API is extracted from the data property of the event argument. For this hook function, we extract userId and subforumId . Then, a call to the makeRequest function is made, passing in the API reference created earlier, the GraphQL query that we want to execute, along with the variable needed to perform the query. In this case, both the userId and subforumId are passed as variables to the query. Once the query has successfully been executed, the function will return the data response. In this case, we are only interested in the allFavorites value that is returned. This is an array of Favorite objects that belong to the user and match the subforum they are attempting to create a favorite for. This means that if the array has any Favorite objects in it, the user has already favorited this subforum. This check is made by checking if the length of the array is 0. (empty) If the array is empty, then the user has not favorited this subforum already, so they should allow to favorite it. In this case, the data submitted by the user is saved to the database. If the length of the array is anything other than 0, then user should not be allowed to create a favorite. An error is returned to the user and the data is not saved.","id":"development/6-codeAnalysis/3-api.html#userandsubforumisunique"},"analysis/3-investigation/3-endUser.html#users-that-have-different-interests":{"title":"Users That Have Different Interests","breadcrumbs":"Analysis » The Investigation » Users That Have Different Interests","id":"analysis/3-investigation/3-endUser.html#users-that-have-different-interests","body":"Users of the site will have different interests, which means that Corum needs to work well for all, and the site should not be designed for only one type of content.

Instead, I will have to create my own using Graphcool resolvers. As talked about already, graphcool provides ways to extend its functionality. Resolvers are one of many extension points that graphcool provides. Resolvers essentially allow you to create custom GraphQL queries and mutations on top of the auto-generated CRUD ones such as allPosts , createPost etc. To find out more about Graphcool resolvers, visit the graphcool docs here. ( graph.cool/docs ) To create a user authentication system, the resolver must do the following: Expose a GraphQL mutation called authenticateUser This mutation will have the following inputs and outputs: Inputs: email -> type String (The email of the user) password -> type String (The password of the user) Outputs: ID -> type ID (ids are generated by graphcool and are unique, the users ID will be used to determine the state of the UI) username -> type String (The username that is associated with the email address entered. This is what other users see on posts and comments) token -> type String (A JWT (JSON Web Token) that will be stored to be later used to authenticate the user when making requests such as to create a new post) Check if a user with the email provided exists If one does not, then return a generic error to the user saying something such as 'Invalid credentials'. (Intentionally vague error message for security reasons) Now that we have confirmed that the user exists, we can check if the user entered the correct password for the user Using a password hashing library (probably something like bcryptjs), hash the password the user entered and compare the hash with the one stored on the server If they do not match, then return the same generic error of 'Invalid credentials' If the hashes match, then we know that the user has entered both the correct email and correct password Now we can return the user the data that they requested. As mentioned briefly above, the token output is a JWT (JSON Web Token). JWTs are extremely useful when dealing with stateless protocols such as HTTP. JWTs can be used to verify that the client is who they say they are. In an application such as Corum, users that are not logged in should not be allowed to create new posts or new comments. By sending the JWT in the header of every HTTP request to the GraphQL API, I can ensure that only logged in users can perform actions such as creating new posts and comments. To find out more about JWTs, visit the following link. ( jwt.io ) Some of this will only make complete sense after reading through how Corum will create the users in the first place.

As Corum aims to be similar to Reddit, it will likely foster the same type of content on it.

(This could be sharing news, collaborating on research, or just chatting to each other.) The reason why an end user would use Corum over a site such as Reddit could be for many reasons. For example, it could be that they like the democratic system of moderation as discussed, or that they prefer the modern experience that Corum will provide. Also, there are two different types of users that could use Corum; the users that regularly visit and actively engage in discussion, and the users that will only ever visit the site when directed from a search engine.
