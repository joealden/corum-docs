# The Analysis

In this section of the report, I will explain how I analysed the data that I got
from the previous sections and what information I got from this analysis. This
section is split into 5 sub sections:

* 'Essential Features' - This is where I explain what all of the essential
  features of Corum are.
* 'Computational Methods Required' - This is where I explain what computational
  methods will be required to create a solution.
* 'Success Criteria' - This is where I outline the success criteria for the
  project.
* 'Limitations of the Project' - This is where I explain some of the limitations
  that the solution will likely have.
* 'Hardware and Software Requirements ' - This is where I explain the hardware
  and software requirements to run both the server and the client.
