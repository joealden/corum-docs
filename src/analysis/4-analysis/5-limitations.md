# Limitations of the Project

## Account Recovery

If the user losses their email / password, they will not be able to recover it.
I am deciding not to include this feature, as this version of Corum is only a
prototype, and the creation of this feature is not essential, and it would take
quite a lot of time to get working.

## Creation of new sub-forums

Unless I have time near the end of the project, I will not be implementing the
ability to add new sub forums. This can still be done manually by the owner of
the site, so it is not an essential feature to implement just yet.

## Responsive CSS

Having responsive CSS would mean that the site would look good on both desktop
and mobile devices. As mentioned, this is just a prototype version of the site,
and as it is only a visual problem, it would be unwise to spend a lot of time
making it look good on mobile devices.
