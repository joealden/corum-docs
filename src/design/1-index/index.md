# Design

In this section of the report, I will be doing the following:

* Coming up with what Corum's interface will look like
* Thinking about how I can separate the interface into modules / components
* Figuring out the best way to design and structure the API of Corum
* Outlining the routes / different pages that Corum will have
* Creating a test plan and data that will be used throughout development
