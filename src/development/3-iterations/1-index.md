# Iterations during Development

In this section I will be talking about how the development of Corum happened
over time, and how it can be described as an iterative process.

This section is split into three sub sections:

* 'Version Control' - This is where I explain the benefits of using a version
  control system and how it meant that I could iterate faster and safer.
* 'Iteration Stages' - This is where all of the major iteration stages are
  explained, and the reasoning behind developing Corum in this way.
* 'User and Stakeholder Feedback' - This is where I talk about how I got
  feedback from my friends, family and stakeholders on Corum during and at the
  end of Corum's development.
