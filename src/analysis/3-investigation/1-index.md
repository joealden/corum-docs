# The Investigation

In this section of the report, I will explain how I performed an investigation
that will be used to inform me on what features Corum should have. This section
is split into 4 sub sections:

* 'Interviews' - This is where I talk about and show the interviews I held with
  my target audience.
* 'The End User (Stakeholders)' -
* 'The Focus Group' -
* 'Research into Existing Systems' -
