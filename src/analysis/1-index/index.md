# Analysis

In this section of the report, I will be doing the following:

* Outlining my proposed idea
* Investigating existing similar systems
* Figuring out who the audience (end user) of my product is
* Forming a focus group of this audience
* Interviewing this focus group for feedback on the idea and existing systems
* Coming up with a list of essential features
* Thinking of what computation methods will be required to solve the problem
* Creating a list of success criteria that I will use throughout the project
* Outlining possible limitations of the project
* Thinking about hardware and software requirements
