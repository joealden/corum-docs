# Interviews

I will be interviewing people that I know are users of Reddit to get an idea of
what they like and don't like about Reddit. This will help me understand what
features I should borrow, leave out, as well those that could be added that
don't currently exist.

## Questions

1.  What do you like about it?
1.  What don't you like about it?
1.  What do you use regularly on it?
1.  What do you not use on it?
1.  What would like to see in the future on it?

## Insights Gained from these Interviews

As a summary from these interview responses, I can tell the following:

* People like how the Reddit voting system works
* People want a more modern version of Reddit (like a web app)
* People dont like how cluttered Reddit's UI is
* People like the idea of Reddit, but think it could be executed better

I will take these interviews responses into account when designing and
developing Corum.
